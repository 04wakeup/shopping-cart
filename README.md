# ThinkFood

## Overview

ThinkFood is a web application where customer can order foods online. Instead of googling each restaurant
to order foods, with ThinkFood, it lets you easily find and order foods in one website with out much hustle.
The feature for the website is to have a menu for each category by foods and restaurant. Make purchases,
view order history and much more. For the administrator, they can add and remove menu from the
website, and as for restaurant owner they receive orders from the administrator.

The objective is to design a website where customers can add, remove, rate, comment, make purchases, and view
history of their orders. As for the Owner users, they can add and remove product, view the order of their customers,
and deliver the food to the customer. For the Restaurant users they can view the orders they received. We will
implement a database and have it all integrate into the website.
